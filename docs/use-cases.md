## Use Case Details

<TODO:>

- Capture the differences between the client and the server. For example, putting the burden on the client to do filtering doesn't scale more than dozen packages.

### List of Packages

The package manager provides a means to list the all the packages. The client can page through results, and may implement client side filtering, however a package manager with thousands of packages may not scale well, requiring [server side filtering](#filter-a-list-of-packages).

### Filter a List of Packages

The package manager accepts filtering parameters to limit the [list of packages](#list-of-packages) to match some criteria.

### List Versions

The package manager provides an API, listing the versions.

### De-dupability

The package manager has the ability to efficiently, and securely store duplicate elements of different packages within the service. The client has the ability to pull unique elements of a package, making the GET of a package more efficient.

### Multi-Architecture Support

The package manager provides a means to query for a package, specific to a OS Platform and architecture.

### Dependency Tracking

<TODO:>

...for package manager lifecycle management.

- [ ] Can the server track the dependencies of a specific package?
- [ ] Can the server track cross package dependencies?
