# Welcome to the CNCF Artifacts Working Group

[![CI](https://github.com/cncf-tags/wg-artifacts/actions/workflows/testing.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/cncf-tags/wg-artifacts/actions/workflows/testing.yml)

<!-- Mission Statement -->

In the distributed world of cloud-native computing different artifacts and
packages are used to transport configuration and code for the many services and
capabilities that comprise and support workloads and applications. As an
example, today ArtifactHub advertises that it can crawl about 20 such artifact
types [1]. These "cloud-native" bundles add to the previous proliferation of
package and artifact types for software dependencies such as Maven and npm and
for system packages like deb and rpm. This abundance of package types and
formats adds complexity and risk for cloud application developers and
architects trying to provision and run cloud-native workloads. Different tools
and controllers must be carefully learned and installed to bundle, unbundle,
verify and deploy each artifact type. This complexity slows product development
by users, impedes innovation and collaboration amongst projects, and increases
risks of insecure configuration. To reduce this complexity and facilitate
collaboration and innovation, WG Artifacts will gather stakeholders from many
CNCF and open source projects offering packaging, distribution and deployment
mechanisms for bundles of configuration and code.

## Scope
<!-- If this section is too long, you might consider moving it to a SCOPE.md -->
<!-- More information about creating your scope with links to examples -->
<!-- https://contribute.cncf.io/maintainers/governance/charter/ -->

### In Scope

[TODO: PROJECTNAME] is intended to [TODO: Core functionality]. As such, the
project will implement or has implemented:

- [TODO: High-level Item 1]
- [TODO: High-level Item 2]
- [TODO: High-level Item 3]

### Out of Scope

[TODO: PROJECTNAME] will be used in a cloud native environment with other
tools. The following specific functionality will therefore not be incorporated:

- [TODO: Excluded function 1]
- [TODO: Excluded function 2]

[TODO: PROJECTNAME] implements [TODO: List of major features, existing or
planned], through [TODO: Implementation
requirements/language/architecture/etc.]. It will not cover [TODO: short list
of excluded items]

## Communications

<!-- Fill in the communications channels you actually use.  These should all be public channels anyone
can join, and there should be several ways that users and contributors can reach project maintainers. 
If you have recurring/regular meetings, list those or a link to a publicy-readable calendar so that
prospective contributors know when and where to engage with you. -->
